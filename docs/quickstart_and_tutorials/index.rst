Setting up the simulation data
---------------------------------------------------------

epx-results comes packaged with a test model, "simpleflu", which is used to
demonstrate usage and features of this package. If FRED is installed at the time
epx-results is installed, this simulation will be run and may alreay be available.
If this is not the case, the "simpleflu" model can be run by executing::

   pytyhon ./scripts/generate-test-data.py




Tutorials
=====================

Tutorials on the use of the epx-results package are coming soon.
