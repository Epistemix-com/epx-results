This builds the documentation in `./_build/html`. On a Mac, this can be opened in a browser by:

```terminal

```

The documentation for this projected is hosted by Read the Docs at [https://epistemix-epx-results.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/index.html#](https://epistemix-epx-results.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/index.html#).

This project uses [autodoc](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html) to document the Python functions and classes that make up epx-results.

In orde to update the API documentation generated by autodoc for the version of the documentation hosted by Read the Docs, you must run the following commands:

```terminal
sphinx-apidoc -o ./ ../epxresults
```

This will generate a set of files: **`epxresults.rst`**, **`epxresults.tests.rst`**, and **`modules.rst`**. Any changes in these files should be commited and included in any PR that updates the documentation. See
