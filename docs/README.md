# epx-results Documentation

The documentation for this project is built with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).


## building the docs locally

Ensure you have installed the `doc-shared` submodule dependencies

```shell
git submodule update --init
```

Install Sphinx requirements (note this is `docs/requirements.txt` as opposed to
the project root's `requirements.txt`)

```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To build the documentation for epx-results locally, execute the following command:

```terminal
make clean html
```

This builds the documentation in `./_build/html`. On a Mac, this can be opened in a browser by:

```terminal
open _build/html/index.html
```

## Read the Docs

The documentation for this projected is hosted by Read the Docs at [https://epistemix-epx-results.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/index.html#](https://epistemix-epx-results.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/index.html#).

This project uses [autodoc](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html) to document the Python functions and classes that make up epx-results.

In order to update the API documentation generated by autodoc for the version of the documentation hosted by Read the Docs, you must run the following command:

```terminal
sphinx-apidoc -o ./ ../epxresults
```

This will generate a set of files:

- **`epxresults.rst`**
- **`epxresults.tests.rst`**
- **`modules.rst`**. 

Any changes in these files should be commited and included in any PR that updates the documentation.
