    Creates a global list variable, `g_list_of_symp_count_by_age`, that
    logs the number of infectious symptomatic cases in different age brackets.

    Depends on agents being given a `my_age_bracket_index` personal variable
    in the `AGE_BRACKET` condition.

    An agent is considered to be a infectious symptomatic when they enter the
    `INF.Is` state.

variables {
    # Output every other day and at the end of the simulation
    global_list g_list_of_symp_count_by_age
    g_list_of_symp_count_by_age.output_interval = 2
    g_list_of_symp_count_by_age = list(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
}


state INF.Is {
    # Modify `INF.Is` state so that agents entering it log that they are now
    # infectious symptomatic within their age bracket in
    # `g_list_of_case_count_by_age`.
    g_list_of_symp_count_by_age[my_age_bracket_index] = \
        g_list_of_symp_count_by_age[my_age_bracket_index] + 1
